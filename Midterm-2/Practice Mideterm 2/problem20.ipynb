    "This problem will exercise your knowledge of pandas, SQL, Numpy, and basic Python. It has **8** exercises, numbered 0 to 7. There are **18 available points.** However, to earn 100%, the threshold is just **15 points.** (Therefore, once you hit 15, you can stop. There is no extra credit for earning more than 15 points.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each exercise builds logically on the previous one. **However, they may be completed independently.** That is, if you can't solve an exercise, you can still move on and try the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point values of individual exercises are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exercise 0: 2 points\n",
    "- Exercise 1: 2 point\n",
    "- Exercise 2: 2 points\n",
    "- Exercise 3: 2 points\n",

    "- All test cells use **randomly generated inputs.** Therefore, try your best to write solutions that do not assume too much. To help you debug, when a test cell does fail, it will often tell you exactly what inputs it was using and what output it expected, compared to yours.\n",
    "- If you need a complex SQL query, remember that you can define one using a [triple-quoted (multiline) string](https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/introduction.html#strings).\n",
    "- If your program behavior seem strange, try resetting the kernel and rerunning everything.\n",
    "- If you mess up this notebook or just want to start from scratch, save copies of all your partial responses and use `Actions` $\\rightarrow$ `Reset Assignment` to get a fresh, original copy of this notebook. _(Resetting will wipe out any answers you've written so far, so be sure to stash those somewhere safe if you intend to keep or reuse them!)_\n",
    "- If you generate excessive output (e.g., from an ill-placed `print` statement) that causes the notebook to load slowly or not at all, use `Actions` $\\rightarrow$ `Clear Notebook Output` to get a clean copy. The clean copy will retain your code but remove any generated output. **However**, it will also **rename** the notebook to `clean.xxx.ipynb`. Since the autograder expects a notebook file with the original name, you'll need to rename the clean notebook accordingly.\n",

    "## Background ##\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you'll analyze how people move from year-to-year within the United States. The main source of data is the US national tax collection agency, known as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n",
    "\n",
    "When Americans pay their taxes, they are required to tell the IRS when they move. The IRS, in-turn, publishes this information as aggregated statistics, which can be used to help study migration patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use these data to try to predict where Americans will live fifty years from now, in the year 2070. You might care about this question because you are thinking about where to expand your business, or because you are a policy planner concerned about how the natural pattern of human movement might interact with, say, the changing climate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll combine data from two sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The IRS's Tax Migration Data\n",
    "* Population data, including numbers of births and deaths, as collected by the US Census\n",
    "\n",
    "Your overall workflow will be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You will use the tax migration data to model the flow of people year-after-year. Your model is a first-order Markov chain, just like PageRank (Notebook 11). The result of this analysis will be a probability transition matrix, which predicts what fraction of people living in one place will move to another.\n",
    "2. You will determine the population in different parts of the US today, using US Census data. The relative populations in each part of the US will become the \"initial distribution\" vector for PageRank.\n",
    "3. Combining (1) and (2) above, you can run PageRank to determine the \"steady-state distribution\" of who lives where in a future year (say, 2070).\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis will allow you to compare the most populous places in the US today with those predicted for the year 2070."

    "For instance, recall the ranking by income-per-return (IPR) in Exercise 7. In the final rankings, the counties in the top 10 are relatively rich (recall the IPR ranks are in the low hundreds, whereas there are over 3,000 counties). However, they are not \"too rich.\" Perhaps it is easier to move to regions where incomes are higher than where one comes from, but not so high that one cannot afford to move at all. A deeper analysis of income and mobility would certainly be fun!\n",

Indeed, this problem was inspired by [this article from the New York Times on human migration and climate change](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/23/magazine/climate-migration.html), which you might enjoy reading now that your exam is over.\n",
