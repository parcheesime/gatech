# Georgia Tech Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my personal repository for some classwork of the Georgia Tech Data Analytics program. This repository contains projects, assignments, and other practical applications of data analytics and machine learning that I've completed as part of this graduate program.

## Overview

This repository is organized by course modules and includes a variety of topics such as Python programming, R scripting, statistical analysis, machine learning models, and simulations. Each directory/folder is dedicated to specific subjects or projects to demonstrate my skills and learning progression throughout the OMSA program.

## Repository Elements

- **Python**
  - Projects and exercises focusing on data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning implementations using Python.
- **R**
  - R scripts and markdown files demonstrating statistical analysis, data visualization, and predictive modeling.
- **Simulation**
  - Simulation models developed for various coursework scenarios, including both discrete-event and continuous simulations.
- **Machine Learning Models**
  - Comprehensive machine learning projects, including supervised and unsupervised learning models, developed during the program.
- **Other Models**
  - Additional analytical models and projects that showcase advanced techniques in analytics and data science.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **R**: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, caret, shiny
- **Software and Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, RStudio, Excel

## Projects

Below is a list of selected projects included in this repository:

### Python
